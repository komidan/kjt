# komi's Trickjumps
This plugin is meant to make trickjumping more popular by creating commands that enable sharing and managing jumps easier.

### Installation
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/komidan/ktj/releases), build from source, or to get the most up-to-date with all commits you can use `./addons/amxmodx/plugins/ktj.amxx` from source. It's kept up to date with every push I make, but keep in mind it's most likely unstable! Follow these steps once you have the plugin file:
1. Move `ktj.amxx` to `./Half-life/cstrike/addons/amxmodx/plugins/`.
2. Edit `.../addons/amxmodx/configs/plugins.ini` by adding `ktj.amxx` to the bottom of the file.
3. Launch Counter-Strike 1.6 to see if it worked. If not then... ask someone?

## F.A.Q
### 1. **How to fix "Load Error 17 (Invalid file format or version)" error?**
This error can mean one of two things according to [this](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=244801) post on AlliedMods.
1. AMX Mod X is not running which you can check by typing `meta list` and seeing `AMX Mod X` in the list.
2. You have an outdated AMX Mod X version. This plugin is compiled using `AMX Mod X Compiler 1.10.0.5467` Update it.
